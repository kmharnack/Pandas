1. While there are more than 5x as many male players to female players, female players have higher average total purchases by >$0.40. 
2. The largest age group of users is the 20-24 range, and they have the 3rd highest average purchases per person. 
3. The groups with the highest average purchase price are the 35-39 year range and the under 10 users. While under 10 may seem like an odd deviation from other age trends, these users may have parents or guardians supporting their purchases.
